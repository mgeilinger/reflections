How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Pluses and minuses are obvious and quick.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Quicker bug checks.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Saves space and marks important points in work.
    Cons: More reliable to have everything saved.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because a change can effect multiple files however text files that work independently donâ€™t require multiple saving.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows you the history of a repos
git diff compares two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can resurrect broken files.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Working in a team!
